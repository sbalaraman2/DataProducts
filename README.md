Developing Data Products - Project
This is the first project for the Developing Data Products course. The purpose of the project is to use Shiny to create an interactive web application.
Tornado Explorer
This application is based on the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Weather Service.
Data for this application has been obtained from http://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/#jmc and processed to fit the application needs
This application lets you explore the impact of tornadoes in the US states. The first input is the month to be explored. The 2nd input is the scale of the tornado. The application lets you select multiple choices for the scale of the tornado.
The application displays the results in a map format. The first map shows the number of tornadoes in the states with the states color codes based on the number of torndaoes. The 2nd map shows the number of fatalities in the states with the states color coded based on the number of fatalities.
The states that do not have any impact will be grayed out.
